# SnTraceViewer
Trying to analyze and visualize detailed log files of a sensenet ECM working instance.
Trying to use remote LINQ taking advantage of the strongly typed programming but reducing code distribution problems.
Trying to apply map-reduce pattern to minimalize the data transfer.

History:
- **V0.2**: Rewritten analyzer API based on LINQ with minimal extension.
- **V0.1**: Analysis is ported from original solution of the SenseNet.Tools
- **V0.0**: Primitive and naive approach of the visualization.
